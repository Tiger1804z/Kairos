The final oral presentation task requires students to select a topic related to their field of study and find two recent articles (or one longer article) on that topic from reliable sources, such as The Guardian or The New York Times. The articles must be in English and at least 300 words long. Students are to prepare a PowerPoint presentation, consisting of at least four slides, including one for references. They should use visual aids and speak for 2-3 minutes. The presentation is structured in three parts: an introduction with the topic, article title, author, and source; a body summarizing the main ideas; and a conclusion offering the student's opinion. Links to the articles must be submitted by July 2nd, and the presentation is scheduled for Class 14. Additionally, an evaluation grid is implied for assessment, though specifics are not provided in the text.
